The prototypes for application testing and demonstration will be a kind of the standard distributed applications - chats.
These chats will have an isomorphic code model and will be flexible concerning their Contextinformation Codings.

 * Command-Line (mainly for backend testing)
 * Browser ([GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs))
 * Android ([golang/mobile](https://github.com/golang/mobile))
 * iOS ([golang/mobile](https://github.com/golang/mobile))
