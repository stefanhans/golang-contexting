# Contextinformation Packet (CIP) Reference Implementation as Go Package
Contextinformation Paket (CIP) is the data structure to transfer contextinformation
plus header and possibly application data through Contextinformation Routing Networks (CRNs).
All information which has to be transferred inside CRNs has to be encapsulated within CIPs.
