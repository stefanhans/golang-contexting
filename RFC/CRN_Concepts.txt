1.  Introduction

   It started with thinking about context-aware services.  Here,
   context-awareness shouldn't be limited to location-based aspects, but
   it should cover any kind of context.  Concepts for an open,
   unrestricted and flexible structure to support context-aware services
   had to be developed.  It should not only be applicable for
   established services but also ready for the emergence of new ones.
   For this purpose the following questions had to be answered:

      How can a framework connect communication partners with matching
      communication interests and context?

      How can it be open for all types of interests and context?

      How can it be open for presently unknown extensions?

      How can it be organized to maximize the availability of the
      service?

      How can it be organized to minimize the customizing effort for
      applications using the service?



   Let me now introduce the main concepts:

   Contextinformation (CI)
             Contextinformation (CI) refers mainly to the known terms
             information and context.  Due to the lack of a useful clear
             distinction between the two, CI is defined here as
             information within its described context, i.e. context
             becomes part of CI by describing it.  Another aspect of CI
             is the accuracy with regard to possible matches with other
             CI.  All of these has to be converted into a general
             format, in which the actual meaning is not relevant to find
             matching CI.



   Contextinformation Coding (CIC)
             Contextinformation Coding (CIC) is the conversion of CI
             into a binary format and vice versa.  CIC means both, the
             conversion rules (CIC-Ruleset) for a particular type of CI
             and a concrete piece of encoded CI.  Every CIC has an
             identifier, called CIC-Number.  A CIC-Ruleset and all its

Internet-Draft     Contextinformation Routing Networks        April 2017


             encoded CI are linked by this CIC-Number.  Encoded CI has
             the form of two parallel bit strings of equal length.  This
             pair consists of CIC-Content, an instance of the CIC-
             Ruleset, and CI-Mask, which is used to define the accuracy
             of the searched match.  Then it is sufficient for a bitwise
             match of two pieces of CI if both CIC-Contents are equal or
             both CI-Masks mark them as non-relevant.
             Let me illustrate this with an example.  Offer and Request
             are two communication roles, and Location is a type of CI.
             Offer says "I'm available for any Request with matching CI
             to contact me" and Request says "I'm searching for any
             Offer with matching CI".  Both have an exact information
             about their location and can define a surrounding area
             where Offer is available respectively Request is searching.
             CIC-Content, as the encoded location, together with CI-Mask
             defines the surrounding area by marking bits of CIC-Content
             as true in any case concerning the match.  Here the CI of
             Offer and Request are matching if the location of one is in
             the surrounding area of the other and vice versa.



   Contextinformation Packet (CIP)
             Encoded CI is encapsulated in a data structure named
             Contextinformation Packet (CIP).  A CIP is divided into
             three parts:

             *  Header Data

             *  Contextinformation

             *  Application Data

             All information which has to be transferred inside CRNs has
             to be encapsulated within CIPs.


   Contextinformation Routing (CIR)
             Contextinformation Routing (CIR) takes place in an overlay
             network built normally on top of the TCP/IP layer.  It is
             organized basically by using CIC-Content as an index.  It
             is oriented towards known concepts of network routing,
             peer-to-peer and others network principles and B-tree like
             data structures.

2.  Motivation

   The motivation for this document is mainly the publication to prevent
   proprietary rights of third parties hindering the general
   availability of its described concepts.  Another additional
   motivation is the exchange with interested experts.  This draft is
   the first step towards a possible formal recognition as an Internet
   Standard in the future.

3.  Contextinformation Coding (CIC)

   Contextinformation Coding (CIC), i.e. a CIC-Ruleset, defines an
   injective function between a set of CIC-Contents and a set of
   permutations of a binary string with a fixed byte length, i.e. there
   is exactly one bit string for every described content of the CIC-
   Ruleset.  CI-Mask, the second binary string, is not defined
   individually by the CIC-Ruleset.  CI-Masks are not part of the CIC-
   Ruleset, but is part of the encoded CI.

3.1.  Internal Structure

   The internal structure of CIC is self-referential.  This means an
   encoded CI can be part of other encoded CI and can contain other
   encoded CI.  Likewise, a CIC-Ruleset can be part of other CIC-
   Rulesets and can contain other CIC-Rulesets.  A CIC, not containing
   other CICs, is called CIC-Module.  The outermost CIC is called a
   Root-CIC.  A Root-CIC can be part of another CIC.  There it is no
   longer a Root-CIC.  Every CIC needs at least one CIC-Number.  A CIC
   can even be interchangeable internally and in which case it needs one
   CIC-Number for each possible CIC.

3.1.1.  CIC-Brick

   Encoded CI consists of a pair of bit strings with its length rounded
   up to the next byte.  One of these byte pairs is called a CIC-Brick.
   One byte string is named CIC-Content and the other is named CI-Mask.
   CIC-Content stands either for encoded CI or for a CIC-Number.  One
   CIC-Brick can contain more than one items, i.e. encoded CI and CIC-
   Numbers.  The Root-CIC must have a length rounded up to the next byte
   lately.

               Figure 1 shows the structure of a CIC-Brick.

   0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8
   + ----+---- +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |                  CIC-Content                  |
   + ----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
   |                   CI-Mask                     |
   + ----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

   The calculation of a match between two CIC-Bricks uses the following
   function or bitwise expression respectively:

   match(Offer, Request) = ( NOT ( Offer-Content XOR Request-Content ) )
   OR ( Offer-Mask AND Request-Mask )

3.1.2.  CIC-Number

   Each CIC-Ruleset and all its encoded CI have an individual CIC-Number
   in common.  In general, a CIC-Number can be well-known or temporary.
   The CIC-Numbers of the Root-CICs must be well-known and they are part
   of the Contextinformation Packet specification (CIP-Specification).

3.1.3.  CIC-Spam and CIC-Padding

   CIC-Spam describes bits of a CIC which have no meaning.  Every
   encoded CI of the same CIC-Number must have the same length.  If
   encoded CI does not have the agreed length of its CIC-Ruleset, it
   will be filled with CIC-Spam (0-bits resp. NULL values).  This is
   called CIC-Padding.

3.2.  Boolean Operations

   Boolean operations are not applicable to CICs directly, but to their
   result sets.  I.e. instead to use boolean operations on encoded CI,
   set operations have to be used on result sets.

      Boolean conjunction (AND) equates to set intersection (INTERSECT)

      Boolean disjunction (OR) equates to set union (UNION)

      Boolean negation (NOT) equates to set difference (MINUS)

   These set operations are executed normally outside the CRNs.

3.3.  Types of CIC-Rulesets

   It is neither specified how CIC-Rulesets should look like nor exist
   any regulations how they should interact with applications.

3.4.  Deployment of CIC-Rulesets

   CRNs provide an infrastructure for CIC-Rulesets.  This can, but must
   not, be used for distributing CIC-Rulesets.  Any other way is
   possible according to the intended availability.

4.  Contextinformation Packet (CIP)

   For the concepts of the CIP's main parts see the following sections.
   For detailed CIP specification see Internet-Draft "Contextinformation
   Paket (CIP) Specification for Contextinformation Routing Networks
   (CRNs)" [CIP_Spec].

4.1.  Header Data

   The header data concern all metadata not directly related to CIC.
   The header data starts with a part of fixed size and static structure
   followed by a dynamic part.  The static part defines the dynamic
   part's type and its length.

4.2.  Contextinformation

   The Contextinformation starts with a part of fixed size and static
   structure followed by a dynamic part.  The static part defines the
   dynamic part's type and its length.  The dynamic part consists of
   CIC-Bricks only.

4.3.  Application Data

   The application data starts with a part with fixed size and static
   structure followed by a dynamic part.  The static part only defines
   the dynamic part's type and its length.

5.  Contextinformation Routing (CIR)

   For the main concepts of the CIR see the following sections.  For
   detailed CIR specification see Internet-Draft "Contextinformation
   Routing (CIR) Specification for Contextinformation Routing Networks
   (CRNs)" [CIR_Spec].

Internet-Draft     Contextinformation Routing Networks        April 2017


5.1.  Universal Aspects

   Within CRNs, and according to client-server model, the client aspects
   of CIR are referred to as CIR-Client(s) and the server aspects as
   CIR_Server(s) analogously.  Independent of the purpose, the following
   aspects of CIR are universal:

5.1.1.  Overlay Network

   CIR can be built on top of any digital network, especially on top of
   the TCP/IP layer over the internet, intranets and (mobile) ad-hoc
   networks.

5.1.2.  Encoded CI as Index

   The structural factor of CIR is the encoded CI itself.  CIC-Content
   is used like an index and CI-Mask marks the branchings.  The lowest
   number of branchings of a routing responsibility (CIR-Node)
   corresponds to the permutations of a byte of encoded CI, i.e. 256
   (cf.  CIC-Brick).  Thus CIR structure can be described as a tree data
   structure (CIR-Tree) with that particular degree of 256.

5.1.3.  Conception as Reactive System

   According to "The Reactive Manifesto" [ReactiveManifesto] CIR is
   oriented towards the following conceptual specifications:

   Responsive
             The CIR-Servers use a heartbeat functionality to ensure
             that the system reacts in a timely manner.



   Resilient
             CRNs, and CIR-Servers in particular avoid any single point
             of failure by replicating relevant information and
             delegating isolated tasks according to current availability
             of services within the CRN.



   Elastic
             As part of a CRN, every hardware device has a role as CIR-
             Server soever, and provides resources accordingly.  In the
             case of an impending partial overload appropriate
             procedures distribute proactively the load among suitable
             CIR-Servers.

Internet-Draft     Contextinformation Routing Networks        April 2017


   Message Driven
             To avoid having resources blocked while waiting for
             response CIR sends a message without relying on the
             response.  In other words, it doesn't matter for recipients
             who send this message.



5.2.  Different Purposes

   Apart from the very varied end use of applications, there are the
   following intrinsic purposes of CIR:

5.2.1.  Application's CI Match

   This routing is oriented on the CIC-Bricks using CIC-Content as an
   index.  If a bit of CI-Mask is true, the routing will be split to
   follow both paths of the indexing.

5.2.2.  Application's Network Address Updates

   To optimize the availability of the applications in volatile
   networks, e.g. mobile devices in the internet, CRNs have a procedure
   to check the applications' address information and the applications
   have a procedure to update these.

5.2.3.  CIC-Ruleset Requests

   Similar to the encoded CI routing CRNs provide an infrastructure to
   store and retrieve CIC-Rulesets.

5.2.4.  Storage and Data Analytics

   Similar to the encoded CI routing CRNs provide an infrastructure to
   store and retrieve CIC-Rulesets.

5.2.5.  Metadata and Internal Usage

   CRNs communicate aggregations and other metadata, if asked for or if
   the result set of matching CI is too large.

6.  Limitations

   Contextinformation Packet (CIP) defines a maximum number of CIC-
   Bricks.  But a CIC can use an unlimited number of CIPs in a row.
   Here, related to one CIP, the end point of the Contextinformation
   Routing (CIR), i.e. the matching communication partner, is the start
   point for the next CIR, related to the next CIP, and so on.  Seen

Internet-Draft     Contextinformation Routing Networks        April 2017


   from another perspective, every CIP lives in its own
   Contextinformation Routing Network (CRN) with its own CICs.  There
   the CIC finds its route through these CRNs.

7.  Emergence and Future Use

   Due to the simple basic principles, the broad applicability and the
   unrestricted length of CI, the resulting codings and the applications
   using them can not be foreseen, provided that CRNs will be used
   numerously.  The resulting emergence is probably the key aspect of
   CRNs.  Even the main application principles of today are possibly not
   complete or major relevant ones are missing still.  Therefore the
   specifications leave room for future use.

8.  Security Considerations

   The use of contextinformation routing networks described in this memo
   has no direct impact on the security of the Internet.
