                       CIP Specification for CRNs

Abstract

   Contextinformation Paket (CIP) is the datastructure to transfer
   contextinformation plus header and possibly application data through
   Contextinformation Routing Networks (CRNs).  All information which
   has to be transfered inside CRNs has to be encapsulated within CIPs.
   This document is the specification of CIP.  For an overview about
   CRNs please see Internet-Draft "Concepts of Contextinformation
   Routing Networks (CRNs)" [CRNs].

1.  Introduction

   Contextinformation Packet (CIP) is the datastructure to encapsulate
   encoded Contextinformation (CI).  A CIP is divided into three parts:

   Header Data
             The header data contains metadata and specifies, among
             other things, how the data of the following two parts has
             to be interpreted.  The header data starts with a part of
             fixed size and static structure followed by a dynamic part.

Internet-Draft         CIP Specification for CRNs           January 2017


             The static part defines also the dynamic part's type and
             its length.



   Contextinformation
             The Contextinformation starts with a part of fixed size and
             static structure followed by a dynamic part.  The static
             part defines also the dynamic part's type and its length.
             The dynamic part consists of CIC-Bricks only.



   Application Data
             The application data starts with a part of fixed size and
             static structure followed by a dynamic part.  The static
             part defines only the dynamic part's type and its length.



   All information which has to be transfered inside CRNs has to be
   encapsulated within CIPs.

2.  Motivation

   The motivation for this document is mainly the publication to prevent
   proprietary rights of third parties hindering the general
   availability of its described concepts.  Another additional
   motivation is the exchange with interested experts.  This draft is a
   first step towards a possible formal recognition as an Internet
   Standard in the future.

3.  Binary Representations of Elements

   Ordered Numbering
                  These elements show unsigned integers, e.g. from 0 to
                  255 (see figure 1).

   Flags
                  These elements show one flag per bit (see figure 2).

   Combinations
                  The representations of ordered numbering and bitwise
                  flags can be combined freely within elements.

   Well Known Representations
                  These representations are well known as standards like
                  IP address, port number, UUID etc..

   Reserved Zero Value (RZV)
                  Nearly all of the not well known representations have
                  the so called Reserved Zero Value.  That means zero as
                  value is reserved for developing and testing purposes.

      Figure 1 shows bytes representing an ordered numbering example.

   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0| 0 represents "Null" (RZV)
   |0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1| 1 represents "A"
   |0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0| 2 represents "B"
   |0|0|0|0|0|0|1|1| 3 represents "C"
   |0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0| 4 represents "D"
   |...............|
   |1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1| 255
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

         Figure 2 shows bytes representing bitwise flags example.

   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0| 0 represents "Null" (RZV)
   |1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0| 1 represents "A, not B, not C"
   |1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0| 2 represents "A, B, not C"
   |1|1|1|0|0|0|0|0| 3 represents "A, B, C"
   |0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0| 4 represents "not A, B, not C"

   Field sizes, shown in brackets, are given in bytes.  Dots are used to
                     show the dynamically sized part.

4.1.  Fix Sized Header Data Elements

   request (RZV)
                  A number of the enumeration of Services (Ordered
                  Numbering) shows the service requested by the sender
                  of the CIP.

   profile (RZV)
                  A number of the enumeration of Service Groups (Flags)
                  shows the services available by the sender of the CIP.

   version (RZV)
                  The version of this specification.  It has a higher
                  4-bit part which represents the major number and a
                  lower 4-bit part which represents the minor number.

   channel (RZV)
                  A number of the enumeration of Channels separating
                  communication traffic related to different purposes.

   UUID
                  The unique identifier of the CIP.

   IP address
                  A 32-bit IP address (Network Byte Order) of the sender
                  of the CIP.

Internet-Draft         CIP Specification for CRNs           January 2017


   IP port
                  A 16-bit port number (Network Byte Order) of the
                  sender of the CIP.

   time
                  Unix time of CIP's introduction, i.e. the number of
                  seconds between 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970 and the
                  moment the CIP arrived in the CRN for the first time.

   type (RZV)
                  A number of the enumeration of Additional Header Type
                  of the additional data of the CIP.

   size
                  The size of the following additional data of the CIP,
                  i.e. its number of bytes.

4.2.  Enumerations for Fixed Sized Header Data Elements

4.2.1.  Services

   'Service Groups' describes the role(s) in CRNs.

4.2.2.  Service Groups

   'Service Groups' describes the role(s) in CRNs.

     Figure 4 shows the service groups and its defined first two bits.

   0         1         2         3  ------------------------------  8
   +---------+---------+---------|----------------------------------+
   | gateway | router  | storage |         not yet defined          |
   +--------------------------------------------------------------- +

   Thus the integer 1 means 'gateway', 2 means 'router' and 3 means both
                               and so forth.

4.2.3.  Channels

   'channel' describes the separated channels in CRNs.

     Figure 4 shows the service groups and its defined first two bits.

   0         1         2  ---------------------------------------   8
   +---------+---------+--------------------------------------------+
   | heartbeat  | routing | application           not yet defined   |
   +--------------------------------------------------------------- +

     Thus the integer 1 means 'client', 2 means 'gateway' and 3 means
                                   both.

4.3.  Types of Additional Header Data

   The types of additional header data are not yet specified.

5.  Contextinformation

   Figure 2.2.1 shows the context (brick) section of the context CIP.  A
          context brick consists of two bytes: content und mask.

   0                   1                   2                   3

   | .............. additional data up to 510 bytes .............  | dyn
   | .............. i.e. up to 255 CIC-Bricks  ..................  | |
   | ............................................................  | |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   Field sizes, shown in brackets, are given in bytes.  Dots are used to
                     show the dynamically sized part.

5.1.  Fixed Sized Contextinformation Elements

   type (RZV)
                  The type can be used to specify different context
                  designs in the future.  The value for the core
                  functionality is 1 which has to be used at the moment.
                  The value 0 is reserved for testing and all other
                  values has no meaning so far.

   root-CIC (RZV)
                  The mask is the second part of a Context Brick (see
                  section 2.4).  It is not used in the core
                  functionality so far.

                  The number of Context Bricks as additional data (up to
                  255).

   additional data
                  The additional data contains the number of Context
                  Bricks (see section 2.4) as specified in size.

5.2.  Enumerations for Fixed Sized Contextinformation Elements

5.2.1.  Types

   'type' describes the very main types of contextinformation in CRNs.

5.2.2.  Root-CIC

   The usage of Root-CIC, i.e. CIC-Content and CIC-Mask, depends on
   'type' and is not yet finally decided.

5.3.  Dynamically Sized Contextinformation

   A Context Brick is a pair of bytes in particular content and mask.
   It describes a piece of information and the relevance of its
   exactness.  The meaning of the Context Bricks is not known by the
   Context Network.

   content
                  The content represents an exact information encoded in
                  a byte.

   mask
                  The mask represents the relevance of the exactness of
                  the content in a byte.  For that a 1 makes the
                  corresponding bit of the content irrelevant.  Two bits
                  are corresponding, if they are at the same place in
                  the byte.

   The following figure shows the data section of the context CIP.  This
    section has no meaning for the Context Routing itself.  The meaning
      of this section is only relevant to the clients.  Therefore the
    following structure has to be seen as a default and can be changed,
     if another specification is agreed between the concerned clients.
     The 'size' has to be as if the default structure would be actual,
                i.e. available is then 'size + 141' bytes.

   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   Field sizes, shown in brackets, are given in bytes.  Dots are used to
                     show the dynamically sized part.

6.1.  Fixed Sized Application Data Elements

   type (RZV)
                  The meaning or format of the following text, e.g.
                  plain text, URL.

   size
                  The size of additional data in bytes.

6.2.  Enumerations for Fixed Sized Application Data Elements

6.2.1.  Types

   In combination with certain values of fixed sized header elements,
   'type' may describe application data related to CRN's functionality
   internally.  The relevant specifications are not determined yet.

6.3.  Types of Additional Application Data

   The application data contains as many bytes as specified by 'size'.
   According to the 'type' the application data has to be interpreted
   appropriately.  This data is meant normally for applications outside
   the CRN.  By internal routing procedures the applications are the
   nodes of the CRN itself and therefore this data is used, in this
   case, not by applications outside the CRN.  Depending on the header
   data additional application data can be used for external
   applications or for the CRNs internally.

6.3.1.  For External Applications

   If additional application data are related to external applications,
   the type of the data and the data itself are the responsibility of
   the external applications exclusively.

6.3.2.  For Internal Use

   The types of additional application data for internal use are not yet
   specified.

7.  Core Services

   The application data contains as many bytes as specified by 'size'.
   According to the 'type' the application data has to be interpreted
   appropriately.  This data is meant normally for applications outside
   the CRN.  By internal routing procedures the applications are the
   nodes of the CRN itself and therefore this data is used, in this
   case, not by applications outside the CRN.  Depending on the header
   data additional application data can be used for external

                           Table 2: TCP Services

   RZVService
                  The type can be used to specify different context
                  designs in the future.  The value for the core
                  functionality is 1 which has to be used at the moment.
                  The value 0 is reserved for testing and all other
                  values has no meaning so far.

   HeartbeatService
                  The mask is the second part of a Context Brick (see
                  section 2.4).  It is not used in the core
                  functionality so far.

   OfferRequestService
                  The number of Context Bricks as additional data (up to
                  255).

   ReplyService
                  The additional data contains the number of Context
                  Bricks (see section 2.4) as specified in size.

   DefaultService
